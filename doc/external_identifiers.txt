External identifiers
--------------------

External identifiers are identifiers that can be associated
with AIRT incidents. User-provided external identifiers must
not start with an underscore (_), as that symbol denotes
reserved prefixes.

Identifiers starting with an underscore should not be shown
to a user without doing appropriate post-processing.

Reserved external identifier prefixes
-------------------------------------

_OTRS   Used for the integration with OTRS. The external
        identifier takes the form _OTRS2006081010, which
        refers to OTRS ticket number 2006081010.

_QNET   Used for the integration with Qnet.
