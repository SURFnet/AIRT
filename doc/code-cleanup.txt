Work plan for the AIRT Spring Code Cleaning
-------------------------------------------

Main targets:

1. Full multilingual preparation for GNU gettext, including all required
   documentation for all relevant people.

2. Where relevant, add Doxygen documentation to functions, and document 
   the full procedure to generate external API documentation from these.

3. Scrutinise the universal use of string escapes for SQL generation.

4. Have a general look at everything that might need cleaning.
