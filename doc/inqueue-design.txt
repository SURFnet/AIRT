Design of the AIRT-2 Import Queue
===============================================================================
$Id$

The AIRT-2 Import Queue is a mechanism to send machine-generated notices to
AIRT. The notices are presented to AIRT via one of several intake mechanisms
(SMTP mailbox, HTTP(S) POST drop, command line, ...), filtered down to one
generic, robust XML format using the correct input filter, and stored in the
AIRT Import Queue. This queue can be reviewed by AIRT users and the notices
can be either rejected or accepted. Accepted notices are mapped to a normal
AIRT "New Incident" form, ready to be added to the AIRT system with a single
button click.


Intakers
--------
At first we implement the command line intaker. This one likely will be the
work horse of the subsequent intakers anyway.


Input filters
-------------
First implementation is a plain passthrough filter, which assumes to get XML
input.


Import Queue
------------
Table design and routine operations, limits, policies.


Import Queue Manager
--------------------
PHP/HTML implementation of a viewer and limited commander for the Queue.


Form Injector
-------------
Bit of code to extract required and optional data from the standard XML and
present this to the already existing Incident Form. We need only a few items
here:

Incident type  (installation-dependent)
Incident state (installation-dependent)
Incident status (likely defaulting to 'open')
Affected IP address(es) with corresponding constituency/cies
Affected user(s) as E-mail addresses

The two check boxes (create user and prepare mail) need to be examined in
more detail.

File to inject to (with POST or GET) likely will be incident.php, the GET
option might need to be added.
