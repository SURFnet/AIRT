The objective of this project is to develop a system for incident response for
end-users. We propose to build this incident response support system by using
existing components, most notably the request tracker component.

However, as request tracker is a fully independent product, the interface
between RT and LIBERTY needs to be as small as possible. Furthermore, we will
not adjust the RT database schema in any way, shape or form and locate all
integration between RT and LIBERTY on the LIBERTY side.

The role that RT plays in LIBERTY is the role of mail handling and
categorization.
