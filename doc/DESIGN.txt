The objective of this project is to develop a system for incident response for
end-users. We propose to build this incident response support system by using
existing components, most notably the request tracker component.

However, as request tracker is a fully independent product, the interface
between RT and AIR needs to be as small as possible. Furthermore, we will
not adjust the RT database schema in any way, shape or form and locate all
integration between RT and AIR on the AIR side.

The role that RT plays in AIR is the role of mail handling and
categorization and to provide authentication data for users. 


SESSIONS
========

AIR uses PHP sessions to maintain some form of state. The following session
variables are available

userid            : user id of the current user
username          : user name of the current user
active_ip         : last manipulated IP address (search/incident)
active_incidentid : last manipulated incident ID (search/incident)
active_ticketid   : last manipulated RT ticket ID (search/edit)

Sessions will remain valid as long as the IP address of the requestor remains
the same, when the userid/username remains set and when the user remains
unidle for less than a settable amount of time.

AUTHENTICATION
==============

Authentication is achieved by checking a username/password combination against
the request tracker information. The user must be a member of a settable RT
group. The password in RT is a base-64 encrypted MD5 hash.
