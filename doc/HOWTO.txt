1. How to customize appearance (aka I want _my_ logo!)

	AIRT ships "out of the box" without any predescribed graphical formatting.
	To customize the appearance of AIRT, activate the custom features login in
	the AIRT configuration file. This is done by uncommenting the statement
	that defines CUSTOMFUNCTIONS.

	The file with your custom functions should contain the following:

		registerEventHandler('pageHeaeder', 'showPageheader');

		function showPageHeader($data) {
			/* do your customization here; $data is an associative array with
			 * two keys: title and helptopic.
			 /
		}
