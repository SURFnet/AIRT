1. How to customize appearance (aka I want _my_ logo!)

	AIRT ships "out of the box" without any predescribed graphical formatting.
	To customize the appearance of AIRT, activate the custom features login in
	the AIRT configuration file. This is done by uncommenting the statement
	that defines CUSTOMFUNCTIONS.

	The file with your custom functions should contain the following:

		registerEventHandler('pageHeaeder', 'showPageheader');

		function showPageHeader($data) {
			/* do your customization here; $data is an associative array with
			 * two keys: title and helptopic.
			 /
		}

2. How to customize the login procedure

	To implement your own login procedure, two steps need to be taken. 
	
	Begin with catching the event 'loginscreen', which is generated after the
	login screen is shown. 

	Authenticate the user in such a way that you are able to find the correct
	id as stored in the users() table. If the user provides incorrect
	credentials, call the function airt_invalidCredentials(). The argument to
	the function should be some kind of key value that you used to
	authenticate the user (login, SSL CN, etc);
	
	Then, using this id, call the function airt_initSession() with the id as
	parameter. This function sets up the required context. All error messages,
	warnings and communication with the user is something you will have to do
	yourself.
