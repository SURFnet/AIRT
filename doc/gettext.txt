AIRT has support for multiple languages as of version
20060809.1. AIRT's multilingual support was implemented
using GNU's gettext tools.

1. How does it work?

   There are two ways that you can configure AIRT for
   multilingual support. The first is a new configuration
   option in airt.cfg, which will set the default language
   for all users who have not set their personal preferences
   yet. The second is a new field associated with each user
   in which the default language can be overridden for
   individual preferences.

2. Setting the global default.

   Edit 'airt.cfg' and set the value of
     $SETTINGS['defaultlanguage'] 
   to your preferred language. Please use the language code,
   such as 'nl' for Dutch, or 'en' for English.

3. Setting a user's preferred language.

   Log in to AIRT and select Settings > Edit users. You will
   now see a drop-down menu for selecting the language.

4. Translating AIRT to your own language.

   To translate AIRT to your own language, there are two
   options. The first is to mail info@airt.nl and indicate
   that you are willing to translate. We will send you a
   .po-file that you can edit with GNU tools. When you are
   done, we'll send it back and update the next release.

   The other option is to check out AIRT's source via
   Subversion, or unpack the distribution tarball. In the
   po/ directory, follow the following instructions:

   $ touch de.po
   $ make messages

   This will extract all AIRT strings. After you are done
   translating, please send us the updated .po file, and
   we'll make sure it gets distributed with the next
   version.

5. Troubleshooting

   GNU Gettext relies on your operating system's settings.
   AIRT's translations will only work when gettext is
   properly installed. On Debian-based systems (such as
   Sarge, Etch, but also Ubuntu), please make sure that the
   'locales' package is installed. You can do this by giving
   the command

   $ dpkg -l locales

   If the output begins with 'ii' (like below), proceed with
   the next step.

    ||/ Name               Version       Description
    +++-=================-==============-===============================
    ii  locales            2.3.18         common files for locale support

    make sure that your locale is defined. On pure Debian
    systems, this means ensuring that the locale of your
    choice is listed in /etc/locale.gen.

    Note that if you change any of the OS-level locale
    settings, chances are pretty high that you'll have to
    let your web server known about it.
