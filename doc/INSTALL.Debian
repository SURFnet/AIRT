INSTALL -- very basic install guide. Probably lacking a lot of implicit
knowledge and additional information.

* Install request tracker, select postgres databases

* Install the AIR package

* Log on to the postgres command line client and execute the SQL statements 
  from the file 'libertyschema.sql'

* edit /usr/share/liberty/lib/liberty.plib and set the variables in the
  beginning of that file

* Create a new queue for the liberty application

* Create a user group for the liberty users and assign the appropriate users
  to that group.

* edit /usr/share/liberty/lib/userfunctions.plib and create at least two php
  functions:

    information about hostname

* Point browser to liberty main screen and add constituencies. Make sure that
  constituency names match the returned strings from the functions defined
