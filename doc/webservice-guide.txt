Guide for using the PHP-WebService

The SOAP WebService written in PHP depends on several PHP PEAR packages. On Debian systems, PEAR is installed using:
   apt-get install php4-pear
Details on installation for other systems is available on:
   http://pear.php.net/manual/en/installation.getting.php

After the installation of the PEAR package manager above, the following PEAR packages will be needed:
   SOAP-beta
   Net_Socket
   Net_URL
   HTTP_Request

These can be installed using the commands:
   pear upgrade-all
   pear install SOAP-beta Net_Socket Net_URL
   pear upgrade Net_Socket
   pear install HTTP_Request

When using HTTPS-support to connect to the SOAP-server, php4-curl is needed. This can be installed using:
   apt-get install php4-curl
or follow the instructions available on http://curl.haxx.se/ for other Operating Systems.
