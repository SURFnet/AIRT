This document describes how to prepare a release of AIRT

Creating the source tarball
===========================
* Update $AIRT/source/VERSION.m4 with the new version number
* Update 00-CHANGES with modify the database version with the same number
* Copy the file appropriately and update $AIRT/doc/database/Makefile.am
* Update $AIRT/source/ChangeLog to relect the same version number
* make clean && make distcheck
* cvs tag rel-version-revision

You now have a tarball.

Creating the Debian package
===========================

* in package/, give the command "dch --newversion=VERSION-REVISION" and edit
  the changelog. Be terse in the changes, but summarize them well. The point of
  changelog is to allow other admins to decide if they want the upgrade, or
  not.
* Check that the email address is correct
* copy the source tarball to /usr/src/airt/ (or anywhere else, for that
  matter), rename it to airt_version.orig.tar.gz, and unpack it
* cd into the new directory and mkdir debian
* cp $AIRT/package/debian/* debian
* run 'debuild' and make sure that lintian does not complain about anything

Testing
=======
* Grab the new package and install it on a clean installation
  somewhere. I use a Debian Sarge VMWare Virtual Machine which I
  revert to its pristine state every time I do it.
* Create the database and populate it according to the install manual
* Log in, search for IP and create incident

Releasing
=========
* If all tests were passed, cd to $AIRT and cvs tag 'rel-version', e.g.
  cvs tag rel-20050812-1 (note; cvs tags cannot contain periods)
