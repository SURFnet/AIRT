AIRT knows two kinds of plugins. First, the event mechanism can be used
to modify the behaviour of AIRT-Core. Second, the add-in mechanism can be used
to add functionality to AIRT-Core.

All plugins can be found in the source distribution in the plugins/ directory.
The structure of that directory, including the required directory tree and some
required files, can be found in the README file on the top level of the plugin
tree.
