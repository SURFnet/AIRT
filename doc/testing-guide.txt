AIRT testing guide

Introduction

	This document describes the test framework for AIRT's beta testers. Please
	use it as a guideline to experiment with AIRT and answer the questions
	listed in the last paragraph when you feel that you are ready to do so.

	The AIRT beta testing period has been decided to run from March 1, 2005
	until March 31, 2005.

	If you encounter any problems during the beta testing period, please use
	AIRT's sourcerforge to communicate with the project members. The workspace
	can be found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/airt/

	Bug reports: please submit your bugs to the bug tracker. It can be found
	at http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=110280&atid=656330

	Feature requests: please submit your feature requests to 
	http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=110280&atid=656336

	Support requests: please submit your support requests to 
	http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=110280&atid=656334

	Please note that while we are strongly dedicated to making AIRT a product
	of high quality, we cannot promise that feature requests will be
	addressed, or that you will receive rapid responses to bug reports or
	support requests. 

	AIRT is available as a Debian GNU/Linux archive. Please add the following
	apt-source to /etc/apt/sources.list: 
	deb http://www.leune.org/debian/ unstable airt

	If you prefer a tar release, please use the support tracker mentioned
	above.

Testing framework

	AIRT testing is not meant as a hand-held click-by-click guide, but rather
	as a useful excercise designed to help you get AIRT set up and running for
	your organisation.

	The beta test phase has been divided in three sub-parts: installation and
	configuration, extensibility and additional functionality. Please use the
	questions listed above as a guideline.

Installation and configuration

	For this section, please install the AIRT package by using the command 
	apt-get install airt (given as root) and follow the instructions in the
	README file, which can be found in /usr/share/doc/airt/. In that
	directory, you will also find additional information and examples.

	After AIRT has been set up, please refer to the AIRT tutorial (also
	availabe in the documentation directory) to enter the initial networks and
	incident information.

	Question 1: Is the information provided with AIRT enough to install
	and configure it?

	Question 2: Were you able to configure AIRT in such a way that it is
	useful in your organization?

	Question 3: Did you encounter any problems or difficulties when
	you were entering data 

	Question 4: Did AIRT offer enough out-of-the-box functionality to be
	useful?

		4a) Is the IP search adequate and correct?
		4b) Is the incident management module adequate and correct?
		3c) Is the mail template module adequate and correct?


Extensibility

	AIRT has been built in an extensible fashion. An initial attempt to
	document the extensibility features of AIRT is described in the files
	HOWTO.txt (with reference in session-variables.txt and events.txt).

	Question 5: Did you, or are you planning to use the AIRT extensibility
	features?

	Question 6: If applicable, were you able to use AIRT's custom search and
	custom classification? Did it offer all functionality that you required?

	Question 7: If applicable, were you able to use AIRT's event mechanism?
	Did it offer all events that you were looking for?


Extra functionality

	This is really a catchall section. 

	Question 8: What kind of extensions for AIRT would you be willing and able
	to contribute to the project?

	Question 9: What kind of extensions for AIRT would you like others to see
	develop and contribute to the project?

	Question 10: Do you have any other comments regarding AIRT ?
