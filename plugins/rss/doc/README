rss.php is a simple script that functions as an RSS aggregator. It depends on
the PEAR class XML-RSS, which may be installed on your system by giving the
command

pear install XML-RSS

To install the plugin, simple copy it to a location which can be accessed by
your web server and add a URL to it using the AIRT main menu URL link option.
The feeds that will be syndicated can be configured in the file itself and are
listed near the top of the file.

Please keep in mind that XML-RSS needs to have the option allow_url_fopen to be
on. If used improperly, doing so may introduce a security risk.
