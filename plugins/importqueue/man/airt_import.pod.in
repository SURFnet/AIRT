=head1 NAME

AIRT_IMPORT - CLI work horse for the AIRT import queue


=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<airt_import> [--filter=F<FILTER>] [--help] [--noqueue] [--verbose] [F<FILE>]


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<airt_import> command is used to put a new element into the AIRT import
queue. This import queue subsequently may (semi-)automatically create a new
AIRT incident, subject to operating policies outside the B<airt_import>
program's jurisdiction.

=item B<--filter>[=F<FILTER>]

Each import data type needs a filter. The default filter is F<none> and
functions as a plain passthrough pipe. This filter is only useful if the
data to be imported is already in AIRT XML format, see
F<@DOCPATH@/importqueue/inqueue-design.txt>. For most real-world
applications, other import filters will be required. Several filters come
with AIRT, such as for Cymru and MyNetWatchman. You can add your own filters
in F<@PHPLIBPATH@/importqueue> by taking one of the existing filters as
framework.

=item B<--help>

Shows the usage of the program on the command line.

=item B<--noqueue>

Processes the input via the filter and presents it to the AIRT import queue
for validation, but does not actually queue the incident. Useful for
testing.

=item B<--verbose>

Generates verbose output on stdout while processing. Useful for testing.

=back

Data to be imported may come from a file or from stdin. The program reads
the import data from stdin if no filename is given.

Normally, B<airt_import> is quiet on stdout. Output is returned on stdout
only when requested via --verbose, and on stderr in case of problems. Exit
code 0 means everything went OK, 1 means there was some unrecoverable
problem, which will have been reported on stderr. This behaviour should
facilitate deployment of B<airt_import> from cron or other system background
processes such as maildrop.
