=============================
SETTING UP THE EMAIL IMPORTER 
=============================

First, it would be ideal if the import queue can receive mail. The easiest way
to accomplish this is by defining a local user which is able to receive email
and who is allowed to use a mailfilter. We have set up a dedicate user 'cert'
which is in the group 'cert-data'. 

User uid=102(cert) gid=106(cert) groups=106(cert),1003(cert-data)

The basic premise is that all configuration files that play a role in importing
incidents are owned by this user. Additional write persmissions to those file
are given via group rights.

In the local aliases file, which must be owned by th user cert as follows, we
added a line

-rw-r--r--  1 cert root   495 Oct  3 16:42 /etc/postfix/aliases-local

----- begin aliases-local -----
airt-queue-import-uvtcert: |maildrop
----- end aliases-local -----

In cert's home directory, we have the configuration file

-rw-r--r--  1 cert root 41 Oct  3 17:06 /home/cert/.mailfilter

which contains the line

----- begin .mailfilter -----
include "/usr/local/etc/airt/mailfilter"
----- end .mailfilter

The file /usr/local/etc/airt/mailfilter is owned by cert.cert-data

-rw-rw-r--  1 cert cert-data 403 Oct  4 10:33 /usr/local/etc/airt/mailfilter

The file is writable by the group cert-data, which allows the AIRT application
adminstrator to configure the queue.

It contains the following:

----- begin mailfilter -----
# Mailfilter for UvT-CERT AIRT
# 
VERBOSE=1
AIRT_IMPORT=/usr/bin/import
FILTER_SURFNET_DDOS="$AIRT_IMPORT --filter=surfnet_bot"
MAILDIR=/var/lib/cert-data/Maildir

# SURFnet-CERT DDOS
if (/^From.*cert@surfnet.nl/ && /^Subject: \[SURFnet-CERT#[0-9]+]: DDoS bot gevonden op/)
{
    cc $MAILDIR/.pre-filter
    xfilter $FILTER_SURFNET_DDOS
    to $MAILDIR/.post-filter
}

to /var/lib/cert-data/Maildir/.incoming
----- end mailfilter -----

Using the filter listed above, maildrop attempts to deliver mail in
/var/lib/cert-data/Maildir, which has the following structure:

drwxr-x---  8 cert cert-data  89 Oct  4 10:30 Maildir/
drwxr-x---  5 cert cert-data  36 Oct  4 10:30 Maildir/.incoming
drwxr-x---  5 cert cert-data  36 Oct  4 10:23 Maildir/.post-filter
drwxr-x---  5 cert cert-data  36 Oct  4 10:23 Maildir/.pre-filter

Maildir, Maildir/.incoming, Maildir/.post-filter and Maildir/.pre-filter are
maildirs. To create them, use the maildirmake command of the maildrop package.

The script /usr/bin/import will be executed as user cert and must have write
access to /var/lib/airt/importqueue, which must have the following ownerships:

drwxrwsr-x  2 cert     www-data   25 Oct  4 15:21 importqueue

This ensures that both the maildrop filter can write in it, as well as the web
server. The setguid bit ensures that all files that are created in the
directory are owned by the group www-data.


===========================
SETTING UP THE IMPORT QUEUE
===========================

The import queue must be reachable via SSL. The PHP SOAP library uses CURL to
accomplish this, which means that we need to install the CA certificate of
the AIRT server in a location which can be found by CURL. A logical choice
be to have the entire certificate chain available in /etc/ssl/certs/.

Next, the web service must be configured by editing /etc/airt/webservice.cfg.
In that configuration file, the following two options must be set:

----- begin webservice.cfg -----
define('WS_ENDPOINT', 'https://localhost/airt/server.php');
define('AIRT_CAPATH', '/etc/ssl/certs');
----- end webservice.cfg -----

Note: the second options is currently not yet available on ferguson. The
current version of AIRT has it hard-coded in
/usr/share/airt/lib/importqueue/importqueue.plib. The next version of the
package will fix this.
