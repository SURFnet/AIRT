=head1 NAME

AIRT_EXPORT - CLI work horse for the AIRT export queue


=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<airt_export> [--help] [--noqueue] [--verbose]


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<airt_export> command is used to start up an external task, requested
via the AIRT export queue. Although the program is intended to be used from
B<cron>, it may without problems be called manually, as long as it is from
the correct user account. In normal operations, no command line parameters
are required.

=item B<--help>

Shows the usage of the program on the command line.

=item B<--noqueue>

Picks up the item(s) ready to be run from the AIRT export queue, but does
not flag them as having been started in the queue. Runs the external tasks
as usual. After completion of the tasks, removes their result strings
without putting them into the AIRT export queue. Use this option only when
you are sure that this B<airt_export> is the only one running, i.e., make
sure B<cron> does not spawn one at the same time. Option mostly useful for
debugging.

=item B<--verbose>

Generates verbose output on stdout while processing. Useful for testing.

=back

Normally, airt_export is quiet on stdout. Output is returned on stdout only
when requested via --verbose, and on stderr in case of problems. Exit code
0 means everything went OK, 1 means there was some unrecoverable problem,
which will have been reported on stderr.


=head1 SECURITY

B<airt_export> is built using the philosophy of upgrading privileges when
required. Typically, the program is started as user B<nobody> (certainly not
as user B<root>!), and upgrades to the required privilege level using
B<sudo>. However, the actual B<sudo> commands are not used in the
B<airt_export> executable script; they all are inside the user-provided
wrapper scripts in F<@PHPLIBPATH@/exportqueue>. This means that all
security-sensitive operations are fully controlled by the system
administrator via the F<etc/sudoers> file and the wrappers.
