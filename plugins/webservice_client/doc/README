  The php-client depends on several PHP PEAR packages. On Debian systems,
  PEAR is installed using:
   apt-get install php4-pear
  Details on installation for other systems is available on:
   http://pear.php.net/manual/en/installation.getting.php
  
  After the installation of the PEAR package manager above, the
  following PEAR packages will be needed:
   SOAP-beta 
   Net_Socket 
   Net_URL
   HTTP_Request

  These can be installed using the commands:
   pear upgrade-all
   pear install SOAP-beta Net_Socket Net_URL
   pear upgrade Net_Socket
   pear install HTTP_Request

  When using HTTPS-support to connect to the SOAP-server, php4-curl is
  needed. This can be installed using:
   apt-get install php4-curl
  or follow the instructions available on http://curl.haxx.se/ for other Operating
  Systems.
