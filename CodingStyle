Indent using tabs; use your favorite editor's setting to represent how deep a
tab is going to be.

All functions must be preceded by a comment block which describes the purpose
of that function. Following the following structure:

	/**
	 * Short description of the function
	 * 
	 * Parameters:
	 *   $a: demo one
	 *
	 * Returns:
	 *   an associative array containing the following keuys, etc.
	 */
	function demoFunction($a) {
		return array('return value'=>$value);
	}

Always uses braces to delimit a block, even if there is only one line or
command. For example:

	if ($a == $b) {
		break;
	} else {
		continue;
	}

	function demoFunction() {
		/* do something */
	}

Use single quotes ' to delimit strings wherever possible.
