mail template suggestion in import queue now processed for new incidents;
preferred template is stored temporarily in incident comments, but this needs
to be changed. How do we address template suggestions for import queue elements
that are added to existing incidents? Do we just ignore them?
Also needs to be done: mapping from filter+version_number+event_type -> AIRT type
